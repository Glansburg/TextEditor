# TextEditor

## Hello Welcome to the readMe. page.
The motivation behind this page was to learn more about PWA's working with indexDB, SEO and service workers.
## What I learned
Through this project I learned:
* About service workers
* Learned about use of PWA's
* Learned about condensing data
* Learned how to use indexDB
* That time invested was time well spent and I learned more. 
  
## Being new to web development I came across some issues you may see obvious such as:
* running into a lot of errors to fix
* getting things to populate correctly
 ## Installation
